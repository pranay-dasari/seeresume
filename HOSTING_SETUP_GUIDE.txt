# 24/7 GitHub Pages Hosting Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you host your portfolio website 24/7 on GitHub Pages using your repository:
https://github.com/ps-dasari/seeresume

Your live site will be available at:
https://ps-dasari.github.io/seeresume/

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account (you already have this)
- Your repository: https://github.com/ps-dasari/seeresume
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone Your Repository Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ps-dasari/seeresume.git
cd seeresume
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start a local development server at http://localhost:8080

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/ps-dasari/seeresume
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. This will enable GitHub Actions to deploy your site

### Step 5: Push Your Code (If You Made Local Changes)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. You should see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Once complete, your site will be live!

## Your Live URLs

### Primary URL (GitHub Pages):
https://ps-dasari.github.io/seeresume/

### Secondary URL (Lovable):
Your existing Lovable published URL (as backup)

## How It Works

### Automatic Deployment:
- Every time you push code to the 'main' branch, GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys your site
- No manual intervention needed after initial setup
- Your site runs 24/7 with 99.9% uptime guaranteed by GitHub

### GitHub Actions Workflow:
The .github/workflows/deploy.yml file contains the automation that:
1. Installs Node.js and dependencies
2. Builds your React application
3. Deploys it to GitHub Pages
4. Makes it available at your GitHub Pages URL

## Making Updates

### To update your portfolio:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and deploy
4. Your live site updates in 2-3 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the "Actions" tab for error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
3. Verify the build process works locally with `npm run build`

### If site doesn't load:
1. Check GitHub Pages settings are correctly configured
2. Ensure the repository is public (private repos need GitHub Pro for Pages)
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation

## Benefits of This Setup

âœ… **24/7 Availability**: Your site is always online
âœ… **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages is completely free
âœ… **Professional URL**: Uses your GitHub username
âœ… **Automatic Updates**: Push code and it goes live automatically
âœ… **Version Control**: Full Git history of your portfolio
âœ… **Backup**: Your code is safely stored on GitHub
âœ… **Fast Loading**: GitHub's CDN ensures quick page loads worldwide

## Important Notes

1. **Repository must be public** for free GitHub Pages hosting
2. **Custom domains**: You can add a custom domain later if needed
3. **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages provides free SSL certificates
4. **Analytics**: You can add Google Analytics for visitor tracking

## Next Steps After Setup

1. Share your GitHub Pages URL on LinkedIn, resume, and job applications
2. Consider adding Google Analytics for visitor insights
3. Set up a custom domain if desired (optional)
4. Keep your portfolio updated with new projects and experiences

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub's official Pages documentation
2. Review the Actions logs for deployment errors
3. Ensure your local build works with `npm run build`

Your portfolio will be live 24/7 at:
https://ps-dasari.github.io/seeresume/

Happy hosting! ðŸš€
